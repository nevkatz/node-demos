Node JS Demos

This is the repo I am using to try out new things with Node JS!

Right now I have a simple server-client setup where I am trying various node functions with the file system - creating, deleting, listing, and writing files. My primary aim is to learn enough so that I can use it to build little desktop applications in node - accomplishing what I do with Powershell right now but with a friendly UI for non-coders. Eventually I might try it with electron.

The primary server file is index.js. The files that are used for the client are in the public directory. I have a directory called old_tests that has a bunch of old files. To be candid, I am not really maintaining that now but maybe you can get a sense of things I've tried. 

For the most recent stuff, check out index.js and public.
